## What is DazzleNodes?

**DazzleNodes** ([main project](https://github.com/DazzleNodes/DazzleNodes)) is a curated collection of ComfyUI custom nodes focused on making common image generation workflows easier and more efficient. Each node solves a real workflow problem - from calculating aspect ratios to automatically resizing masks.

## Featured Node

### 🌟 Smart Resolution Calculator

**[GitHub](https://github.com/djdarcy/ComfyUI-Smart-Resolution-Calc) | [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/djdarcy/nodes/comfyui-smart-resolution-calc)**

Flexible resolution and latent generation with intelligent aspect ratio handling. Calculate missing dimensions, preview results, and generate latents - all in one node.


## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Each node has its own repository and contribution guidelines.

### Proposing New Nodes

1. Open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/DazzleNodes/discussions) describing the workflow problem
2. Explain current workaround (how many nodes it takes now, ex. "I need 8 nodes to do X, could we make it 1 node?")
3. Describe proposed solution (how one node would solve it)
4. Provide example use cases (ex. "This error happens constantly in Y workflow, can we prevent it?")
5. Discuss implementation approach

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

DazzleNodes has minimal dependencies:
- ComfyUI (obviously)
- Python 3.10+ (for ComfyUI compatibility)
- Standard ComfyUI node dependencies (torch, PIL, numpy)

Some nodes may use [DazzleLib](https://github.com/DazzleLib) libraries for file operations, but this is optional.
